            <div>
                <p>On October 9th, I embarked on the boot camp journey, diving headfirst into a week dedicated to
                    mastering JavaScript fundamentals. During this initial week, I had the pleasure of meeting my tutors
                    and fellow boot campers. Through introductions and casual conversations, we began to forge
                    connections and get acquainted. Despite my initial nervousness, the warm welcome and the realisation
                    that we were all navigating this new terrain together provided a reassuring sense of unity.<br><br>

                </p>

                <h3>Day 1: Dot Notation & Data Types</h3>
                <p>We explored Dot Notation and Data Types. Dot Notation is a way to interact with objects, enabling us
                    to read,
                    modify, and invoke properties. Data Types are the values we instruct the computer to work with, such
                    as numbers,
                    strings, and booleans.
                    By the end of day 1, I created a nifty random number generator program. It was amazing that with
                    just one line
                    of code, I could get random numbers effortlessly.
                </p>

                <h3>Day 2:</h3>
                <p>Variable Exploration and Naming Conventions
                    Day 2 was an adventure in variables. I learned how they store different types of data and how to
                    manipulate
                    them. We covered the various ways to declare a variable and the art of JavaScript naming
                    conventions.
                    It felt like I was handed a toolkit of endless possibilities. The more I experimented, the more I
                    realized the
                    potential in my code.
                </p>

                <h3>Day 3: If Else Statements</h3>
                <p>
                    Day 3 was all about adding logic to our code. We dove into the world of If-Else statements,
                    giving
                    our programs
                    the power to make decisions.
                    Using Comparison Operators, I practised making my code perform different actions for
                    different
                    decisions.
                    I first practised making a program with a single condition and then crafted a program using
                    multiple
                    conditions,
                    making the code execute different moves depending on the situation.
                    Comparison operators and logical operators
                </p>

                <h3>Day 4: Arrays/Loops</h3>
                <p>Day 4 we studied arrays and objects: Manipulating arrays, accessing object properties, and
                    using
                    built-in
                    methods. Going through loops was eye-opening, in JavaScript one line can be written to
                    repeat a
                    task
                    based on a
                    condition automatically a certain number of times.
                </p>

                <h3> Day 5: JS Tasks</h3>
                <p>Day 5 brought forth an exciting challenge: completing JavaScript tasks in pairs. It was a
                    good
                    opportunity to
                    put our newly acquired knowledge to the test and apply the concepts we had learned
                    throughout
                    the
                    week. Teaming
                    up with a fellow boot camper we tackled the challenges together. We shared insights,
                    compared
                    code,
                    and
                    complemented each other's strengths. As we worked through the challenges, I could feel a
                    sense
                    of
                    accomplishment
                    with every problem solved.
                </p>

                <p>This first week was a whirlwind of learning, and I'm eagerly anticipating what's in store for
                    the
                    upcoming
                    weeks. Learning JavaScript has proven to be quite an exciting ride!
