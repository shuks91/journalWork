                <p>As an aspiring front-end web developer, I was brimming with excitement to venture into the realm of
                    website building and design. While I had dabbled in basic Python and JavaScript, HTML & CSS were
                    uncharted territory for me. The prospect of delving into this space was exciting.
                </p>

                <h3>HTML:</h3>
                <p>HTML, the cornerstone of web development, is the language that breathes structure into web pages. It
                    lays the very foundation upon which every website is built. From defining headings and paragraphs to
                    crafting lists, it forms the scaffolding of content. Moreover, it serves as a canvas for embedding
                    multimedia, from images that tell stories to links that connect worlds.
                </p>

                <h3>CSS:</h3>
                <p>With CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), I unlocked the power to make webpages not only functional but
                    also visually appealing. It's the tool that styles text, backgrounds, and outlines borders. Through
                    Flexbox, I researched elements, how to arrange them in rows, creating visually appealing
                    layouts.
                </p>

                <h3>Semantic HTML:</h3>
                <p>This phase was more than just about code; it was about understanding the principles of web
                    development. Semantic HTML, the building blocks of the digital world. I was starting to understand
                    the reason and purpose of using semantic tags in HTML was to organize the script based on the
                    meaning of the HTML element rather than how it looks.
                </p>

                <h3>Responsive Design: </h3>
                <p>A website's ability to look impeccable- regardless of the device is very important. Responsive
                    design was the key to achieving this. With media queries, I learned to adapt layouts seamlessly,
                    ensuring images scaled gracefully and content flowed harmoniously across phones, tablets, and
                    desktops.
                </p>

                <p>By the conclusion of the second week, I had honed my skills in crafting HTML and CSS within the VS
                    Code environment. I adeptly incorporated images and employed CSS techniques to customize the font
                    and background. Our assigned task was to design a website tailored for composing journal entries,
                    complete with fitting stylistic elements. The due date for this project was set for October 27th.
                    So far it's been a whirlwind journey through the essentials of front-end development. With
                    continued practice and honing of these skills, I'm looking forward to creating great web experiences
                    and unlocking more potential when we come to include JavaScript.
