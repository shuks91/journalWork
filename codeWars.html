                <p>To enhance our learning experience, we were advised to register on
                    Codewars. It is a platform designed for software developers to improve their javascript abilities
                    through
                    various challenges. This site offers a multitude (yes, I checked) of coding katas with varying
                    levels of
                    difficulty, ranging from 8 (the easiest) to 1 (the most challenging). I challenged myself to
                    complete at
                    least one kata every day and even formed a group with my peers - the competitive side in me enjoyed
                    this
                    secretly. Each successfully completed kata earns you points on Codewars' scoring system. Not only
                    does
                    it serve as a fantastic way to practice javascript, but it also helps develop problem-solving
                    skills.
                    Their tagline "Achieve mastery through challenge" was motivating and made the whole experience
                    engaging
                    and fun. This led me to explore other websites that catered towards beginners such as Edabit,
                    Exercism,
                    HackerRank and Advent of Code - which I will be utilising to help me level up my problem-solving
                    skills.
                    One thing I found extremely beneficial while working on a kata was being able to check out other
                    coders'
                    solutions. It was great to see how different people approached the same problem and it helped me
                    broaden
                    my problem-solving skills. Plus, I could do some extra research on the methods they used and gain
                    new
                    insights that helped me write more efficient code. Sometimes, I realized that I was overcomplicating
                    things by writing too many lines of code or creating unnecessary variables. Seeing others' solutions
                    made me realize there are simpler and more effective ways to achieve the same result.<br><br>

                    The above is a challenge I solved on Codewars where you get an array of
                    numbers and return the sum of all of the positive ones e.g. Example [1,-4,7,12]=> 1 + 7 + 12 = 20.
                    In my solution, I check
                    if
                    the input array is empty and returns 0 if it is. I then create a variable called posSum and set
                    it
                    to 0, this is to keep track of the positive sum. I then wrote a loop to go through each element
                    of
                    the array one by one. Inside the loop, if the element is greater than 0 (positive) it gets added
                    to
                    posSum. After going through all the elements the total is returned.<br><br>

                    The kata is solved here in a more concise way using the reduce function.
                    JavaScript reduce() is a higher-order function used in data manipulation that reduces an array to a
                    single value. It takes two parameters: an accumulator and the current element of an array. Its uses
                    include calculating the sum or product of all elements, finding the maximum and minimum value,
                    flattening an array, and more. Also, the reduce function automatically returns 0 for an empty
                    array.<br><br> This is an
                    example
                    of
                    Codewars being great for exposure to more efficient and easier-to-read code. My current score on
                    Codewars is 60. My goal is to attempt at least one kata every day.<br><br>
