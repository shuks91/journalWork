    <p>Week 2: HTML & CSS Adventure
        Week 2 marked the beginning of a new chapter in my coding journey as we delved into the world of HTML and CSS.
        HTML is the language that gives structure to web pages. I learned how to piece the elements of HTML together
        which form the skeleton of a webpage.
