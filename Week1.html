                <p>
                    Day 1: Dot Notation & Data Types<br>
                    We explored Dot Notation and Data Types. Dot Notation is a way to interact with objects, enabling us
                    to read,
                    modify, and invoke properties. Data Types are the values we instruct the computer to work with, such
                    as numbers,
                    strings, and booleans.
                    By the end of day 1, I created a nifty random number generator program. It was amazing that with
                    just one line
                    of code, I could conjure up random numbers effortlessly.<br><br>

                    Day 2: Variable Exploration and Naming Conventions<br>
                    Day 2 was an adventure in variables. I learned how they store different types of data and how to
                    manipulate
                    them. We covered the various ways to declare a variable and the art of JavaScript naming
                    conventions.
                    It felt like I was handed a toolkit of endless possibilities. The more I experimented, the more I
                    realized the
                    potential in my code.<br><br>

                    Day 3: If Else Statements<br>
                    Day 3 was all about adding logic to our code. We dove into the world of If-Else statements, giving
                    our programs
                    the power to make decisions.
                    Using Comparison Operators, I practised making my code perform different actions for different
                    decisions.
                    I first practised making a program with a single condition and then crafted a program using multiple
                    conditions,
                    making the code execute different moves depending on the situation.
                    Comparison operators and logical operators<br><br>

                    Day 4: Arrays/Loops<br>
                    Day 4 we studied arrays and objects: Manipulating arrays, accessing object properties, and using
                    built-in
                    methods. Going through loops was eye-opening, in JavaScript one line can be written to repeat a task
                    based on a
                    condition automatically a certain number of times. <br><br>

                    Day 5: JS Tasks<br>
                    Day 5 brought forth an exciting challenge: completing JavaScript tasks in pairs. It was a good
                    opportunity to
                    put our newly acquired knowledge to the test and apply the concepts we had learned throughout the
                    week. Teaming
                    up with a fellow boot camper we tackled the challenges together. We shared insights, compared code,
                    and
                    complemented each other's strengths. As we worked through the challenges, I could feel a sense of
                    accomplishment
                    with every problem solved.<br><br>

                    This first week was a whirlwind of learning, and I'm eagerly anticipating what's in store for the
                    upcoming
                    weeks. Learning JavaScript has proven to be quite an exciting ride!
