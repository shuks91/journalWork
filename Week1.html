    <h1>Javascript Fundamentals. Learning the basics.</h1>
    <p><img src="js image.png"></p>
    <p>Day 1: Dot Notation & Data Types<br>
        We explored Dot Notation and Data Types. Dot Notation is a way to interact with objects, enabling us to read,
        modify, and invoke properties. Data Types are the values we instruct the computer to work with, such as numbers,
        strings, and booleans.
        By the end of day 1, I created a nifty random number generator program. It was amazing that with just one line
        of code, I could conjure up random numbers effortlessly.<br><br>

        Day 2: Variable Exploration and Naming Conventions<br>
        Day 2 was an adventure in variables. I learned how they store different types of data and how to manipulate
        them. We covered the various ways to declare a variable and the art of JavaScript naming conventions.
        It felt like I was handed a toolkit of endless possibilities. The more I experimented, the more I realized the
        potential in my code.<br><br>

        Day 3: If Else Statements<br>
        Day 3 was all about adding logic to our code. We dove into the world of If-Else statements, giving our programs
        the power to make decisions.
        Using Comparison Operators, I practised making my code perform different actions for different decisions.
        I first practised making a program with a single condition and then crafted a program using multiple conditions,
        making the code execute different moves depending on the situation.
        Comparison operators and logical operators<br><br>

        Day 4: Arrays/Loops<br>
        Day 4 we studied arrays and objects: Manipulating arrays, accessing object properties, and using built-in
        methods. Going through loops was eye-opening, in JavaScript one line can be written to repeat a task based on a
        condition automatically a certain number of times. <br><br>

        Day 5: JS Tasks<br>
        Day 5 brought forth an exciting challenge: completing JavaScript tasks in pairs. It was a good opportunity to
        put our newly acquired knowledge to the test and apply the concepts we had learned throughout the week. Teaming
        up with a fellow boot camper we tackled the challenges together. We shared insights, compared code, and
        complemented each other's strengths. As we worked through the challenges, I could feel a sense of accomplishment
        with every problem solved.<br><br>

        This first week was a whirlwind of learning, and I'm eagerly anticipating what's in store for the upcoming
        weeks. Learning JavaScript has proven to be quite an exciting ride!
